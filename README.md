## Bootstrap 3 Offline Chrome Extension

This the Chrome for the Bootstrap 3 Offline documentation via getbootstrap.com .
I will try to update the repo according to BS3 repo.

### Installation
If you've cloned the repo from Github, you can install with Developer Mode.

1. Go to Tools > Extensions inside Chrome by clicking on the wrench icon on top right.
2. Select "Load unpacked extension"
3. Select the "Bootstrap3-Chrome-Extension" folder with manifest.json in it's root
4. Postman will be installed as a developer extension.

Installation via Chrome Web Store will come soon.
